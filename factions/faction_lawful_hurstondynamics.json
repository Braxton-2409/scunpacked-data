    "description": "With a history stretching back over five hundred years, Hurston Dynamics is noteworthy for being not only one of the oldest continuously-operated family businesses in the Empire, but more recently for owning its own planet in the Stanton system. Over the course of fifteen generations of Hurstons, the company made its fortune selling a wide range of weapons to the military and civilians. In addition, Hurston Dynamics produces many of the refined materials and components that other weapon manufacturers rely on.",
