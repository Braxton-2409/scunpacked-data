  "description": "As Hurston Dynamics continued to expand their manufacturing operations in the 25th century, it became necessary to hire more security personnel to protect valuable stock, monitor employee safety, and guard shipments. Rather than shoulder the continued expense of outsourcing, Hurston would create an internal security force to take over these duties. When Hurston acquired the rights to Stanton I in 2865, it was only natural for their own security personnel to take over the responsibility of ensuring the peace and safety of the planet. A common sight on the streets of Lorville, members of Hurston Security are an imposing presence able to quickly respond when the need arises.",
