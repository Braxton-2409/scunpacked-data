    "description": "A brazen hacker collective rumored to have been started by a group disaffected teens on microTech who bonded over their affinity for old technology. Bored by more serious criminals, they are thrill seekers out to make some money, live large, and stick it to the major corporations in Stanton. With a strong preference for digital infiltration and subterfuge, they have been known to bring in outside help when jobs require a more direct approach.",
