    "description": "When the city of New Babbage was first designed, microTech had hoped that they would be able to use advanced monitoring systems combined with automatic response units to handle most security issues that would arise. Unfortunately, as the city flourished so to did criminal elements looking to take advantage of the growing wealth and affluence there.  To more efficiently deal with this growing criminal trend, in 2891 MT Protection Services was formed. While they still rely heavily on tech and remote monitoring, MT Protection Services employs a small force of security professionals who are able to deal with matters requiring a more hands on approach.",
