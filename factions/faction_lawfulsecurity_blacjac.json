  "description": "BlacJac was founded on Tram by local Jac Ngo as a protection service for businesses struggling with the growing outlaw problem there. Before long, the security group earned a reputation for effectiveness and larger corporations began contracting BlacJac to look after matters on other worlds. At the same time, ArcCorp had tried to establish their own security force to look at their newly purchased world, Stanton III, but after a series of setbacks and budget issues, made the decision to employ BlacJac, who had assisted the company in several other security matters, to take over policing duties for the planet in 2906.",
