    "description": "Covalex is one of the largest hauling companies in the \u2019verse; thanks to its policy of contracting with independent ship operators. They learned early on that owners who fly their own ships are more invested in the success of the company and this commitment ensures a higher level of performance. In most systems, at any given time, a large percentage of the ships flying are working under contract to Covalex.",
