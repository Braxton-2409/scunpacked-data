  "description": "ECKHART SECURITY, LLC.\nCONTRACTS & DISPATCH\n\nCONTRACT TYPE: Find Person of Interest\nCONTRACTOR STATUS: Independent\nApproval code: = ~mission(approvalcode)\n\n\nStanton’s megacorps are clearly fed up with the chaos across the system because all four security services are now sharing intel and updates on a level that I’ve never seen. Through this information sharing, they have identified a new criminal organization calling themselves ‘the Slicers’ as the ones responsible for the horrific attacks on Stanton and have gathered intelligence on several individuals they believe are part of this new gang. \n\nOne of these suspects has been spotted hiding at ~mission(Location|address) among the local outlaws who live there. We need you to travel there immediately and neutralize the Slicers operative before they can spread more terror across the system. \n\nThe security services wanted to make it clear that while you may encounter other outlaws, your target remains the Slicers operative. However, if anyone else at the location responds aggressively, then you will be authorized to use force against them. Please prepare accordingly and consider bringing back-up.\n\nPayment will be issued upon successful completion of contract.\n\nThis contract is non-negotiable.\n\nThis message may contain confidential, proprietary, privileged and/or private information. The information is intended to be for the use of the individual or entity designated above.",
