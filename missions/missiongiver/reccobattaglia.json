  "description": "Recco Battaglia, the latest in a long line of miners, had continued the family tradition until an accident at a dig sit left her unable to continue the work. Frustrated with her post-accident treatment under the bureaucracy of the UEE and United Resource Workers, Recco moved out to Nyx where she now coordinates logistics for the local branch of Miners Amalgamated, an alternate union that focuses on helping independent miners.",
