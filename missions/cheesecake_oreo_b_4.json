  "description": "ECKHART SECURITY, LLC.\nCONTRACTS & DISPATCH\n\nCONTRACT TYPE: Cargo Retrieval\nCONTRACTOR STATUS: Independent\nApproval code: = ~mission(approvalcode)\n\n\nThere’s something big cooking across Stanton. I’m getting comms from every planet’s security services looking for contractors to help address the situation. They're calling it 'Operation Save Stanton.' No one knows exactly what’s going on, but here’s what I’ve pieced together. \n\nSomeone’s attacking and looting hauling ships across Stanton. These attacks are clearly planned and highly coordinated. Strange thing is that none of the usual crews are claiming responsibility, so there’s a growing concern that there might be a new gang behind the mayhem. \n\nRight now, the planetary security services are focused on identifying who’s responsible, but they’re being overwhelmed by distress beacons and reports of lost ships. That’s why they’re looking to hire contractors to help track down some of the cargo ships that have been reported lost. \n\nI need someone to travel to ~mission(Location|Address) and then scan to find the lost ~mission(Ship). If you find the ship inoperable or destroyed, your primary objective will be to recover the cargo and take it to the delivery location. Security is saying that the cargo aboard is essential to local operations and must be recovered at any cost. Considering that armed assailants are hunting for this cargo too, I’d make sure your ammo’s topped off and consider bringing back-up.\n\nI don’t know how much of the cargo has already been pirated so I’d recommend bringing a ship with a large cargo hold as well as a Maxlift tractor beam. For security reasons we can only give you the delivery location when we know the cargo has been collected.\n\nPayment will be issued upon successful completion of contract.\n\nThis contract is non-negotiable.\n\nThis message may contain confidential, proprietary, privileged and/or private information. The information is intended to be for the use of the individual or entity designated above.",
